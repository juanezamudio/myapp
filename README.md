# Pocket Farmer

A B2C mobile app designed to be your handy guide to successfully growing your own urban farm from your pocket

# Overview

Pocket Farmer is an app designed to make urban farming accessible and easy to do regardless of where you live geographically or the type of home you live in. Within the app, you can find the tools and resources available to increase the success of your garden, from beginner to advanced farming.

## Problem

With the inflation of food prices, many have noticed an increase in grocery expenses to the extent that they consider growing their food to cut down on the cost and live a more organic lifestyle. Growing your food can seem overwhelming, especially when there is a lack of education on how to start or how to plan on growing something successfully from seed to harvest.

## Solution

Pocket Farmer is a growing educational platform that acts as a resource that users can access and refer to when they feel unsure of how to successfully grow their own food. A planting and tracking system was also implemented based on the user's geographical location for a more personalized experience. The app is designed to remove the uncertainty and create more confidence in growing your own urban farm of herbs, vegetables, or fruits.
